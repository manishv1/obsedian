 the ".vscode" folder can also contain other files, such as "extensions.json" and "tasks.json". The "extensions.json" file allows developers to define a list of recommended extensions for the project, ensuring that all team members have the necessary tools and extensions installed to work on the codebase effectively.




- **`version`**: Specifies the version of the tasks schema.
- **`tasks`**: An array of tasks.
- **`label`**: A human-readable name for the task.
- **`type`**: The type of task, typically "shell" for executing shell commands.
- **`command`**: The command to execute.
- **`group`**: Defines the task group (e.g., "build", "test").

The `"group"` field allows you to categorize your tasks. In this example, we assign the task to the "build" group and set it as the default task. This means that when you open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), and type "Run Task", the "Run Project" task will be selected by default.

Once you have defined your task, you can trigger it by opening the Command Palette and searching for “Run Task”. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+B or Cmd+Shift+B) to quickly run the default build task.

Remember that the tasks.json file is project-specific and resides within the .vscode folder. This means that each project can have its own set of custom tasks defined. You can also define multiple tasks within the same file by adding additional task objects to the `"tasks"` array.
